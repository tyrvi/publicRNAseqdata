# Figure 1
Analysis of 11 data sets with published precomputed FPKM/RPKM values for brain, heart and kidney samples from four different studies.

![**Fig. 1B:** Heat map with Spearman correlations between samples](replicated-figures/fig1B-replicated.png)

![**Fig. 1C:** PCA, PC1, PC2. Tissues types are red (heart), blue (brain), green (kidney) and studies are square (HPA), triangle (GTex), circle (AltIso), star (Atlas).](replicated-figures/fig1C-nolegend-replicated.png)
